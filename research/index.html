			<u><b>Moral Hazard versus Liquidity in Household Bankruptcy</b></u></a>, October 2020 <span style="color:#52de97;">(submitted)</span>
			<br>
			<font size="-1">(previously titled <i>The Impact of Debt Relief Generosity and Liquid Wealth on Household Bankruptcy</i>)</font>
			<br>
			<b>Abstract:</b> This paper studies the role of moral hazard and liquidity in driving household bankruptcy. First, I estimate that increases in potential debt forgiveness have a positive, but small, effect on filing using a regression kink design. Second, exploiting quasi-experimental variation in mortgage payment reductions, I estimate that filing is five times more responsive to cash-on-hand than relief generosity. Using a sufficient statistic, I show the estimates imply large consumption-smoothing benefits of bankruptcy for the marginal filer. Finally, I conclude 83% of the filing response to dischargeable debt comes from liquidity effects rather than a moral hazard response to financial incentives.

			<u><b>Financial Crises and the Transmission of Monetary Policy to Consumer Credit Markets</b></u></a>, October 2020
			<br>
			<b>Abstract:</b> How does the health of creditors affect the pass-through of monetary policy to households? In a financial crisis, 
	asset losses among creditors can either dampen or amplify the effects of monetary policy on lending, depending on how these losses and policies interact with financial frictions. Frictions such as leverage constraints may hinder creditor responses, however easing may instead alleviate frictions that would otherwise constrain lending. Using data on the universe of US credit unions, I document that asset losses <i>increase</i> the sensitivity of consumer credit to monetary policy. Identification exploits plausibly exogenous variation in asset losses and high frequency identification of monetary policy shocks. I find that a one standard deviation asset loss increases the response of credit union lending to a 10 basis point fall in the two-year Treasury rate from a 0.86 to 1.15 percentage point increase. The estimates imply that constraints on monetary policy become more costly in a financial crisis characterized by creditor asset losses and that an additional benefit of monetary easing is that it weakens the causal, contractionary effect of asset losses.

			<u><b>Bad News Bankers: Underwriter Reputation and Contagion in Pre-1914 Sovereign Debt Markets</b></u></a>, February 2021
			<br>
			<b>Abstract:</b> This paper uses new bond-level data on sovereign borrowing and defaults during 1869-1914 to quantify a reputation-based channel of contagion via shared financial intermediaries. Concerns over reputation incentivized Britain's merchant banks, who underwrote sovereign bonds, to monitor, advise, and occasionally bail out sovereigns. Default signaled to investors that a merchant bank was not as willing or able to write and support quality issues, indicating that its other bonds may underperform in the future. Consistent with reputation-based contagion, I find that comovement between defaulting and non-defaulting bonds is six times larger when the bonds share an underwriter. To isolate the causal effect of a shared underwriter, I exploit within-country variation in bonds' underwriters. Testing predictions from a dynamic game that models underwriter reputation-formation, I find further evidence supporting reputation as the mechanism, as opposed to alternative explanations. These findings highlight that the reputation of intermediaries that monitor and intervene in crises can be a powerful source of contagion unrelated to a borrower's fundamentals.

			<b>The Impact of Social Insurance on Household Debt</b> (with <a href="http://www.gideon-bornstein.com/home">Gideon Bornstein</a>)
			<br>
			<b>Abstract:</b> This paper investigates how the expansion of social insurance affects households' accumulation of debt. Insurance can reduce reliance on debt by lessening the financial impact of adverse events like illness and job loss. But it can also weaken the motive to self-insure through savings, and householdsâ€™ improved financial resilience can increase access to credit. Using two quasi-experimental research designs, we estimate the causal effect of expanded insurance on household debt, exploiting the staggered expansions of one of the largest US social insurance programs: Medicaid. We find that expanding Medicaid increased credit card borrowing by 2.2%. Decomposing this effect in a model of household borrowing, we show that increased credit supply in response to households' improved financial resilience fully accounts for this rise in borrowing and contributed to 17% of the total welfare gains of expanding Medicaid.

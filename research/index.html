			<i><b>Moral Hazard versus Liquidity in Household Bankruptcy</b></i></a>, June 2020
			<br>
			Submitted
			<br>
			<b>Abstract:</b>
			<p align="justify">
				This paper studies the role of moral hazard and liquidity in driving household bankruptcy. First, I estimate that increases in potential debt forgiveness have a positive, but small, effect on filing using a regression kink design. Second, exploiting quasi-experimental variation in mortgage payment reductions, I estimate that filing is five times more responsive to cash-on-hand than relief generosity. Using a sufficient statistic, I show the estimates imply large consumption-smoothing benefits of bankruptcy for the marginal filer. Finally, I conclude 83% of the filing response to dischargeable debt comes from liquidity effects rather than a moral hazard response to financial incentives.

			<i><b>Financial Crises and the Transmission of Monetary Policy to Consumer Credit Markets</b></i></a>, May 2019
			<br>
			Submitted
			<br>
			<b>Abstract:</b>
			<p align="justify">
				This paper explores one channel through which financial crises can alter the strength of the credit channel of monetary policy. Analyzing microdata on the universe of US credit unions and exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in exposure to ABS markets, I find that asset losses among lenders increase the sensitivity of their lending to the policy rate. A 10 basis point fall in the two-year Treasury yield generates a 0.86 percentage point increase in quarterly lending growth when assets are unchanged. However, the same policy rate change leads to a 1.15 percentage point increase for a credit union experiencing a one standard deviation asset loss. This is a more than 20% difference relative to median lending growth. Additionally, a 10 basis point policy rate reduction lowers the effect of a one standard deviation asset loss from a 3.20 to 2.91 percentage point decrease in lending growth. These findings suggest that monetary easing is more potent among lenders with recently weakened balance sheets and there exists an additional benefit of monetary easing which reduces the contractionary effect of asset losses.

			<i><b>Bad News Bankers: Underwriter Reputation and Contagion in Pre-1914 Sovereign Debt Markets</b></i></a>, November 2018
			<br>
			Submitted
			<br>
			<b>Abstract:</b>
			<p align="justify">
				This paper uses new data on the timing of sovereign defaults during 1869-1914 to quantify an informational channel of contagion via shared financial intermediaries. Concerns over reputation incentivized Britain’s merchant banks to monitor, advise, and occasionally bail out sovereigns. Default signaled to investors that a merchant bank was not as willing or able to write and support quality issues, suggesting that its other bonds may underperform in the future. In support of this channel, I find that during a debt crisis, a 5% fall in the defaulting bond’s price leads to a 2.19% fall in prices of bonds sharing the defaulter’s bank. This is substantial compared to the 0.24% price drop among bonds with different banks. Information revelation about financial intermediaries can be a powerful source of contagion unrelated to a borrower’s fundamentals. In modern financial markets, third parties such as credit rating agencies, the IMF, or the ECB could similarly spread contagion if news about their actions reveals information about their willingness to monitor risky borrowers or intervene in crises.

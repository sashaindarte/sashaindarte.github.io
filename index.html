				<p> Professor Sasha Indarte is an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. She completed her PhD in Economics at Northwestern University. Her research focuses on household finance, macroeconomics, and financial intermediation. <br>
Her research combines quasi-experimental methods and economic models to explore the causes and consequences of financial distress and default, how households make financial decisions, and the role of financial institutions in shaping economic outcomes. Examples of her ongoing work include studying the impact of expansions of social insurance on households’ financial wellbeing, the origins of racial disparities in consumer bankruptcy, and how financial institutions’ reputation for monitoring can contribute to contagion. <br>
For her research, she has received awards such as the Journal of Finance’s Distinguished Paper Brattle Prize, the Wharton School’s Marshall Blume Prize, and Northwestern University’s Susan Schmidt Bies Prize. Her research has been supported grants from the National Science Foundation and National Bureau of Economic Research. <br>
Professor Indarte teaches MBA and undergraduate Corporate Finance and quasi-experimental methods in a PhD elective course. For MBA teaching, she has received the Wharton School’s Teaching Excellence Award.
